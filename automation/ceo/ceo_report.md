### Health: pipeline=active guardian=active open_pos=5
### Numbers: 24h 54T -$1.53 24.1% | 7d 165T -$0.04 33.9%
### Findings: Pipeline healthy (both services active, 0 CRITICAL alerts); 24h WR stuck at 24.1% for a 2nd status run, 7d PnL flipped slightly negative (-$0.04); alerts show phantom atr_sl_hit <0.01% PnL WARNs (8x) and a redacted REPEATED hotset-failure cluster ~20:01 UTC worth a deep-run look; disk still 83%
### Recommendation: Deep run should autopsye the phantom atr_sl_hit cluster and hold all config changes until the Oct 15 soak checkpoints

### Health: pipeline=active(timer) guardian=active open_pos=0
### Numbers: 24h 62T -$1.30 25.8% | 7d 175T +$0.06 33.7%
### Findings: 24h bleed continues (−$1.30, 25.8% WR); 7d PnL at breakeven edge (+$0.06) — one bad day flips it negative. Timers firing normally; error_alerts show hotset failure cooldowns + BTC range-filter blocks (routine). Open positions flat.
### Recommendation: 7d WR 33.7% vs ≥50% Oct 15 checkpoint will miss — treat Oct 15 soak reviews (bb-squeeze, pump-chain 45m, trail-arm ratify) as the critical path; no new entry filters until then.

## CEO Status — 20261014T054729Z
### Health: pipeline=active guardian=active open_pos=3
### Numbers: 24h 60T -$0.95 25.0%WR | 7d 176T -$1.11 33.0%WR
### Findings: 7d PnL flipped negative again; error log shows disk 84% warn + hotset empty (0 tokens survived compaction); confluence gate currently blocking BABY SHORT (single ichimoku source, not in bypass); trail-arm 2 unratified enables still pending before Oct 15 soak review.
### Recommendation: RATIFY trail-arm 2 enables (brain_auditor corrected +$0.97/30d bb-squeeze) before Oct 15 soak review — it cannot proceed clean while undecided.
